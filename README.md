# Docker
The purpose of this repository is to explore the key features of Docker.

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

# Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, a YAML file is used to configure the application's services. Then, with a single command, all services can be created and started from the configuration.

# Layer Caching
Docker uses a layer caching system to improve the build and deployment process. When a Docker image is built, each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. If a change is made to the Dockerfile and the image is rebuilt, Docker will only rebuild the layers that have changed, which can significantly improve build times.

# Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for storing and sharing Docker images. Docker Hub can be used to store images, as well as to share and discover images created by the community.

# Dockerfiles
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image to use, any dependencies that need to be installed, and any other configurations or settings that the image needs.

# Volumes
Volumes are persistent storage locations used in Docker to store data that needs to be preserved beyond the lifecycle of a single container. They allow data to be stored in a separate location from the container, makes it easier to manage the data and the container separately. This provides better performance and flexibility for certain use cases.

# Exposing Ports
When running a Docker container, certain ports may need to be exposed on the host machine. This allows access services running inside the container from the host machine, or from other machines on the network.
